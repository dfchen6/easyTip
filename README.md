## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Settings page to change the values of tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
